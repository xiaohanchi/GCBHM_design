# GCBHM_design
This repository contains R code for implementing the generalized calibrated Bayesian hierarchical (GCBHM) design.

### Repository Contents

* code_for_rerunning_simu/: R code necessary for rerunning the simulations presented in the manuscript.
* code_for_tables_figures/: R code for reproducing all the tables and figures featured in the main paper and supplementary materials.
* Rdata/: This directory stores saved intermediate results in Rdata files from our simulations. These files are used for reproducing the tables and figures presented in the paper.
* Results/ ALL tables and figures presented in  paper.
* master.R: This file serves as a summary, providing an overview of the code needed to reproduce the results.
